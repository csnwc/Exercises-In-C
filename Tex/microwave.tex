\nsection{Neill's Microwave}

Last week I purchased a new, state-of-the-art microwave oven.
To select how long you wish to cook food for, there are three
buttons: one marked ``10 minutes'', one marked ``1 minute'' and
one marked ``10 seconds''.
To cook something for $90$ seconds requires you to press
the ``1 minute'' button, and the ``10 seconds'' button three
times. This is four button presses in total.
To cook something for $25$ seconds requires three button presses;
the ``10 second'' button needs to be pressed three times and we
have to accept a minor overcooking of the food.

\begin{exercise}
Using an array to store the cooking times for the buttons, 
write a program that, given a required cooking time
in seconds, allows the minimum number of button presses to be determined.

Example executions of the program will look like~:
\begin{terminaloutput}
Type the time required
25
Number of button presses = 3
Type the time required
705
Number of button presses = 7
\end{terminaloutput}
\end{exercise}
